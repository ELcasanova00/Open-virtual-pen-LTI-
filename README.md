# Open virtual pen LTI
Description

Virtual Pen is a simple computer vision project that allows users to draw on the screen using a colored object as a virtual pen. The program tracks the chosen color in real-time from a webcam feed and maps its movement onto a transparent canvas. This project is ideal for beginners learning OpenCV, image processing, and basic contour detection.


🛠 Features

Detect and track a specific color in real-time (default: blue, configurable).

Draw freely on a virtual canvas using the tracked object.

Visualize both the webcam feed and the drawing overlay.

Lightweight and easy to run on any modern system with Python.

🔧 Usage

Move a colored object (e.g., blue marker or pen) in front of the webcam.

The program will track its motion and draw corresponding strokes on the screen.

Press ESC to exit.
